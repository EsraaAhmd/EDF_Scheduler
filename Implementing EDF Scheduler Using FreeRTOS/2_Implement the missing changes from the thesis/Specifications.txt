Inorder for the EDF scheduler to work correctly, you still need to implement some changes that are not mentioned in the thesis:
"1. In the ""prvIdleTask"" function:
Modify the idle task to keep it always the farest deadline"

"2. In the ""xTaskIncrementTick"" function:
In every tick increment, calculate the new task deadline and insert it in the correct position in the EDF ready list"

"3. In the ""xTaskIncrementTick"" function:
Make sure that as soon as a new task is available in the EDF ready list, a context switching should take place. Modify preemption way as any task with sooner deadline must preempt task with larger deadline instead of priority"


"For this criteria please deliver the following:
Tasks.c source file only with the changes mentioned above implemented"
